# Chill Beats
Website made for Human Computer Interaction Class.

Created a website named “Chill Beats.” This website aims to provide a distraction free
and comfort zone for the user, where users can curate and save their own choice of
music (at this stage, youtube links primarily) and images, and get to studying, reading a
book, or just drinking a cup of tea.
The demographics are people who like instrumental music, need a break/ a relaxing
digital space set up by having this one website they can have playing in the background.
