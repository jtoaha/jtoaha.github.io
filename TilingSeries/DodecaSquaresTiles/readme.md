 @Title: Tiling Series: DodecaSquare Rings
 Created an interactive art series that draws n rings around an n-pointed star, default is 12.
 - Originally: This was meant to draw rings of 12 squares around a 12 pointed star, however user may also now adjust the value
 - Slider options to change the number of rings and the circle radius
 - Theme: Light/ Dark
 - Modes: Stationary/ Animations
 - Future Goal: Add feedback for sliders, and possibly different number of squares
