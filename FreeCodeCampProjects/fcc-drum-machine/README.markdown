# FCC - Drum Machine

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/jtoaha/pen/Vwewpbv](https://codepen.io/jtoaha/pen/Vwewpbv).


I built this Drum Machine as part of the Free Code Camp Front End Libraries Track. It is implemented by using React.js, vanilla CSS, and a bit of JQuery(primarily to add event handlers and to add CSS for mouse and keyboard events). Drum audio is accessed and streamed via DropBox, where I stored MP3 files, since Codepen does not have the option of hosting assets for free users.

Overview: This Drum Machine project sets up a drum machine user can interact with, either by:
- Pressing corresponding letter on their keyboard (i.e, 'Q', 'W', 'E', 'A', 'S', 'D', 'Z', 'X', 'C')
- Or simply clicking on a specific button with their mouse.

Every button corresponds to a different sound effect.
Notable CSS Effects added: When user presses keyboard or clicks on button, CSS shows feedback by showing the button being pressed in and briefly changing it's background color. Added Flexbox so buttons space out evenly and is responsive across different screen sizes.

Original Sound Effects Source: [http://www.flashkit.com/soundfx](http://www.flashkit.com/soundfx) This is a great website for sound effects. However, once Flash totally becomes obsolete by the end of 2020, it may become more difficult to navigate.
