# FCC - JS Calculator

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/jtoaha/pen/pogvZxN](https://codepen.io/jtoaha/pen/pogvZxN).

This Javascript Calculator was built as part project for the Free Code Camp Front End Libraries track using HTML/ JS/ CSS. It utilizes React.js to create the Calculator. As well as employs a CSS grid layout. This being a Codepen project, all components had to be placed in one js file.

Calculator logic and input entries implemented from scratch. Implements Formula/Expression Logic (takes into account operator precedence) rather than Immediate Execution Logic.

Due to specs required for Free Code Camp's library which I thought a bit erroneus (regarding inputing operators), the version contained on Github differs from the one I put up on Codepen.
